# ✨ UPDATED: Compound Interest Calculator

## 🎉 New Features Added!

Your Simple Interest Calculator now supports **compound interest** with multiple compounding periods!

### 📊 Calculation Options:

1. **Simple Interest** - No compounding (Original formula: A = P(1 + rt))
2. **Annual** - Compounded once per year
3. **Semi-Annual** - Compounded twice per year
4. **Quarterly** - Compounded 4 times per year
5. **Monthly** - Compounded 12 times per year

### 📐 Formulas Used:

**Simple Interest:**

```
A = P(1 + rt)
```

**Compound Interest:**

```
A = P(1 + r/n)^(nt)
```

Where:

- **A** = Final Amount
- **P** = Principal
- **r** = Interest Rate (as decimal)
- **t** = Time (in years)
- **n** = Number of times compounded per year

## 🚀 How to Run (Updated):

### Step 1: Compile (Already Done!)

```powershell
g++ server.cpp -o server.exe -lws2_32
```

✅ **Your server is already compiled!**

### Step 2: Run the Server

```powershell
.\server.exe
```

### Step 3: Open Browser

Navigate to: **`http://localhost:8080`**

## 🎯 How to Use the New Features:

1. **Enter Principal** (e.g., 1000)
2. **Enter Interest Rate** as decimal (e.g., 0.05 for 5%)
3. **Select Compounding Period** from dropdown:
   - Simple Interest (No Compounding)
   - Annual
   - Semi-Annual
   - Quarterly
   - Monthly
4. **Enter Time** in years (e.g., 2)
5. Click **Calculate**

## 📊 Example Comparison:

**Inputs:**

- Principal: $1,000
- Rate: 5% (0.05)
- Time: 2 years

**Results:**

| Compounding Period | Formula                | Final Amount | Interest Earned |
| ------------------ | ---------------------- | ------------ | --------------- |
| Simple Interest    | A = P(1 + rt)          | $1,100.00    | $100.00         |
| Annual             | A = P(1 + r/1)^(1×2)   | $1,102.50    | $102.50         |
| Semi-Annual        | A = P(1 + r/2)^(2×2)   | $1,103.81    | $103.81         |
| Quarterly          | A = P(1 + r/4)^(4×2)   | $1,104.49    | $104.49         |
| Monthly            | A = P(1 + r/12)^(12×2) | $1,104.94    | $104.94         |

**Notice:** The more frequent the compounding, the more interest you earn!

## 🔧 Technical Changes Made:

### Backend (server.cpp):

✅ Added `compoundingPeriod` parameter to all functions
✅ Created two separate calculation functions:

- `calculateSimpleInterest()` - For simple interest
- `calculateCompoundInterest()` - For compound interest with periods
  ✅ Updated `getInput()` to parse compounding period
  ✅ Updated `createJsonResponse()` to include compounding info
  ✅ Used `pow()` function for compound interest calculation

### Frontend (index.html):

✅ Added dropdown menu for compounding period selection
✅ Formula display changes dynamically based on selection
✅ Results show the compounding type used
✅ Clear button resets formula display

---

## 🎨 UI Features:

- **Dynamic Formula Display**: Formula changes when you select compounding period
- **Dropdown Menu**: Easy selection of compounding frequency
- **Result Display**: Shows which compounding method was used
- **Smooth Transitions**: Formula updates smoothly

## 📁 Updated Files:

```
✅ server.cpp       - C++ backend with compound interest logic
✅ server.exe       - Compiled executable (ready to run!)
✅ index.html       - Web interface with compounding options
📄 README.md        - Original documentation
📄 UPDATES.md       - This file!
```

---

## 💡 Quick Start:

```powershell
# Run the server
.\server.exe

# Open browser to:
# http://localhost:8080

# Try different compounding periods to see the difference!
```
